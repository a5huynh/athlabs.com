	<h2>the magic behind this site</h2>
	First off, a fancy badge:
	<p>
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/" class='image'>
		<img
			src="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/badge/html5-badge-h-css3-semantics.png"
			width="165"
			height="64"
			alt="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling, and Semantics"
			title="HTML5 Powered with CSS3 / Styling, and Semantics">
	</a>

	<p>
	"So how did he do it?" you ask. What sort of magical trickery is this?
	Well stay a while and listen. I'll explain the tech and resources
	behind the site along with various blurbs on <em>why</em> I used each
	resource.

	<h2>icons</h2>
	Those small icons in the upper right where crafted by yours truly. I made them using Adobe
	Illustrator so they're nice and vectorized. <a href='/static/files/social_icons.zip'>Here they are</a>
	for your enjoyment!

	<p>
	The rest of the icons are provided by <a href='http://thenounproject.com'>The Noun Project</a>.
	The icons are free ( with attribution ), simple, and are nicely provided in the SVG format.
	Not much more I could ask for honestly.

	<p>
	Here are links to the icons used
	<ul>
		<li>

			The Noun Project collection.

	<h2>960 Grid</h2>
	The basic layout of the page is based on the a 12 column grid provided by the
	<a href='http://960.gs'>960 grid system</a>.

	<p>
	I like the 960 grid system because it provides a simple to use layout. No more
	playing around with calculating offsets and widths, it's all already done for you
	in the css they provide. Tr√©s bon!

	<h2>backend support</h2>
	None! This entire site is statically generated using the wonderful <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage'>Jekyll</a>

	<p>
	<h2>misc</h2>
	The wonderful <a href='http://jquery.com'>jQuery framework</a> is utilized for my javascript needs.

	<p>
	<a href='http://www.google.com/webfonts'>Google Web Fonts</a> provide that sleek Inconsolata font I
	used for fixed width text for those unlucky few who don't already have it.
