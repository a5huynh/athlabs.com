				<h3>distributed health lab</h3>
			</a>
			<p>
				Distributed Health Lab is a small team of dedicated researchers,
				designers and technologists who understand that there is a better way,
				because each of us has already built at least part of it ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are based at Calit2, the University of California's premier information technology research institute, but our platform is based less on high tech than on building the most resilient, most effective lowest tech possible solutions to real world problems. (If the tech is already built and just needs to be deployed in a smarter way, that's even better.)

				<h3>valley of the khans</h3>
			</a>
			<p>
				As a data scientist on the <a href='http://valleyofthekhans.org'>
				Valley of the Khans Project</a>, Andrew built a platform that enables
				computers to recognize archaeological sites using satellite imagery.
				Dr. Albert Lin and the National Geographic Society are
				using this platform for a <a href='http://exploration.nationalgeographic.com'>
				crowd-sourcing project</a> in Mongolia to find archaeological anomalies
				and to build a better map to guide future exploration in the region.
				NSF has recognized Andrew for his efforts, awarding him both
				“Judges Choice” and “Community Choice” at the annual
				<a href='http://posterhall.org/igert2012/posters/252'>IGERT Poster and Video Competition.</a>
