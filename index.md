## a bit about me now

Currently, I am one of the founders of
[ProductBio](https://angel.co/productbio). We have the grand vision of becoming
the data engine that will power the sustainable economy.

We've been through the [500 Startups](http://500.co) and [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org) accelerators.

Sometimes I [ramble](http://a5huynh.github.io) about things.

## a bit about my past

From the time period of 2010-2014, I was a Ph.D student at the [University of California, San Diego](http://cse.ucsd.edu).

![Where I am](http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=UCSD,La Jolla,CA&amp;zoom=14&amp;size=496x128&amp;markers=color:blue%7CUCSD,La Jolla,CA&amp;sensor=false)

My focus was a combination of *human computation*, *computer vision* and
*machine learning*. Despite that my interests cover everything from human-
computer interaction and computer graphics to astronomy and astrophysics!

A lot of my free time was spent hacking away at various [side
projects](http://github.com/a5huynh), adventuring, or simply enjoying the
fantastic weather that blesses the San Diego biome.
