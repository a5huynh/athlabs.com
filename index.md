## a bit about me now

Currently, I'm a senior software engineer at
[Quid][quid] building key infrastructure and services to make it for
clients to search, analyze, and visualize the world's collective intelligence.

Sometimes I [ramble][blog] about things.

## a bit about my past

For a while, I was the co-founder of
[ProductBio][pbio-page]. We had the grand vision of
becoming the data engine that will power the sustainable economy.

We went through [500 Startups](http://500.co) and
[Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org) accelerators.

From the time period of 2010-2014, I was a Ph.D student at the [University of California, San Diego](http://cse.ucsd.edu).

![Where I am][ucsd]

My focus was a combination of *human computation*, *computer vision* and
*machine learning*. Despite that my interests cover everything from human-
computer interaction and computer graphics to astronomy and astrophysics!

A lot of my free time was spent hacking away at various [side
projects](http://github.com/a5huynh), adventuring, or simply enjoying the
fantastic weather that blesses the San Diego biome.
