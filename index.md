## a bit about me now

Sometimes I [ramble][blog] about things.

Currently I head up data science efforts at [Huckleberry][hberry], helping
build an end-to-end insurance company that uses a modern technology stack
and novel applications of data science to improve the cost and efficiency
of a typically expensive and slow process.

## a bit about my past

For fun, I and talented designer/good friend [Ian][ian-twitter] built a
[simple service][omr] to automatically calculate and carbon offset your ride-shares.

For a little bit, I was a senior software engineer and manager at [Quid][quid]
building key infrastructure and services to make it easier for our clients
to search, analyze, and visualize the world's collective intelligence.

From 2012-2016, I was the co-founder & CTO of a sustainability
[startup][fail]. We had the grand vision of becoming the data engine
that will power the sustainable economy.

We went through [500 Startups](http://500.co) and
[Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org) accelerators.

From the time period of 2010-2014, I was a Ph.D student at the
[University of California, San Diego](http://cse.ucsd.edu).

![Where I am][ucsd]

My focus was a combination of *human computation*, *computer vision* and
*machine learning*. Despite that my interests cover everything from
human-computer interaction and computer graphics to astronomy and
astrophysics!

A lot of my free time was spent hacking away at various
[side projects](http://github.com/a5huynh), adventuring, or simply enjoying
the fantastic weather that blesses the San Diego biome.
