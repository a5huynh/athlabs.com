## the magic behind this site

First off, a fancy badge:

![HTML5 Powered with CSS3/Styling, and Semantics](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/badge/html5-badge-h-css3-semantics.png)

"So how did he do it?" you ask. What sort of magical trickery is this? Well
stay a while and listen. I'll explain the tech and resources behind the
site along with various blurbs on *why* I used each resource.


## icons

Those small icons in the upper right where crafted by yours truly. I made
them using Adobe Illustrator so they're nice and vectorized. [Here they
are](/static/files/social_icons.zip) for your enjoyment!

The rest of the icons are provided by [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com).
The icons are free ( with attribution ), simple, and are nicely provided in
the SVG format. Not much more I could ask for honestly.

Here are links to the icons used:

## 960 Grid

The basic layout of the page is based on the a 12 column grid provided by the
[960 grid system](http://960.gs).

I like the 960 grid system because it provides a simple to use layout. No more
playing around with calculating offsets and widths, it's all already done for you
in the css they provide. Tr√©s bon!


## backend support

None! This entire site is statically generated using the wonderful
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage)


## misc

The wonderful [jQuery framework](http://jquery.com) is utilized for my
javascript needs.

[Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) provide that sleek
Inconsolata font I used for fixed width text for those unlucky few who
don't already have it.
